//Admin tools by Infinity (made from the beginning since lack of compability between versions)

//Take admin on the servers you have admin with the same key
//If you are not on your nick, when you press P to get admin, or when you perform an admin tools command, you will show your admin name, and then turn back to the previous nick (to make it easier for hosts or reporting to know who was it)
//If you perform admin tools commands with a weak reason, it will transform to a valid generic one (to make it faster to ban if needed)
//With letter X you can add a server you are in, putting the pass
//You have a menu (pressing I) to set the name of the player you want to ban just pressing letter U. Useful for example to players with VPN

//goadmin (to take admin if you have it)
//akick (kick with admin)
//aban (ban with admin)
//abanss (aban with remember for infoban and screenshot)
//abanname (aban by the name)
//abannamess (abanname with infoban and screenshot)
//set_abanname (to fastly ban trollers)
